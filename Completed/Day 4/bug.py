# elements = ['a', 'b', 'c']
# print(elements(1))

# The first one has a problem with the parenthesis it should be:
elements = ['a', 'b', 'c']
print(elements[1])

# elements = ['a', 'b', 'c']
# new = 'x'
# new = elements[1]
# print(elements)

# The second one has an issue with placing the command at the right position
# The right code would be:

elements = ['a', 'b', 'c']
new = 'x'
elements[1] = new
print(elements)
